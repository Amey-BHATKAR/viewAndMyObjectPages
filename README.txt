I have only included the files I have worked on while working for the client mutum.fr , from SSII - WorldCorp, for 15 days in the first 15 days of March 2015.

The view pages are for viewing the objects on rent, which are nearby the logged in user, and also a map indicating what are the positions of those objects from the position of the logged in user.

The items pages are for showing all the items, only the items on rent, only the items not rented, for the current logged in user.

The files are divided in controller and views as for this company I was using the PHP-MVC framework.
